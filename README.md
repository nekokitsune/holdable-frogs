# How exactly?

First, you need to craft a Frog Holder.

Then, you need to find a frog. You can then use this Frog Holder on a frog. Doing so will place the frog in your hand. That's it! Once you have the frog in your hand, using it will cause it to shoot out its tongue and pull toward you any entity it hits.

# What can I do with a Handheld Frog?

You can do many things with a Handheld Frog! Namely, you can pull stuff. For example, you can pull fish from the water.
